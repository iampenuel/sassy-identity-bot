# SASSY IDENTITY BOT: The Identity Protocol

A sassy Python program that gathers basic user info like name, age, height, and humanity statusâ€”then reacts to it with dramatic commentary and low-key shade. Built using:

- Python 3
- Input validation (`try/except`)
- f-strings
- Conditional logic (`if/elif`)
- Terminal sass

## What I Learned
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Validating user input with `try/except`
- Building logic trees with conditionals
- How to inject way too much personality into a terminal program
